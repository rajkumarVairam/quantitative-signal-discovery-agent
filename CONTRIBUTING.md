## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and professional in all interactions.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Quant Factor Mining Agent developer example:

- **Report bugs**: If you find a bug, please open an issue with detailed information
- **Suggest enhancements**: Have an idea for a new feature? Let us know!
- **Improve documentation**: Help us make the docs clearer and more comprehensive
- **Submit code**: Fix bugs, implement features, or improve performance
- **Share examples**: Contribute notebooks, examples, or use cases

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- NVIDIA API key from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/settings/api-keys)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quant-factor-mining-agent.git
   cd quant-factor-mining-agent
   ```

2. **Install uv (if not already installed)**

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   For Windows, use:
   ```powershell
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Download Data**

   ```bash
   python -m factor_mining_workflow.download_data
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the following specifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **String quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Import ordering**: Managed by `isort` with Black profile

### Code Formatting

All code must be formatted with:

- **Black**: For consistent code formatting
- **isort**: For import statement ordering

Run formatters before committing:

```bash
black .
isort .
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
- **Type hints**: Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- **Comments**: Write clear comments explaining complex logic

Example:

```python
def evaluate_factor(
    factor_values: pd.DataFrame,
    forward_returns: pd.DataFrame,
    ic_threshold: float = 0.02
) -> dict:
    """
    Evaluate a factor's predictive power using Rank IC.

    Args:
        factor_values: Factor values as a DataFrame (dates x stocks)
        forward_returns: Forward returns as a DataFrame (dates x stocks)
        ic_threshold: Minimum absolute IC value for acceptance

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing Mean IC, p-value, and acceptance status

    Raises:
        ValueError: If DataFrames have mismatched dimensions
    """
    pass
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

We encourage comprehensive testing of all new features and bug fixes.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_evaluator.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in the appropriate `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test function names
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what changes were made and why.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from main:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run all checks** before submitting:

   ```bash
   black .
   isort .
   pytest
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what and why
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

4. **Address review feedback** promptly and professionally

5. **Ensure CI passes** - all automated checks must pass

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines (Black, isort)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new features
- [ ] Documentation updated (docstrings, README, etc.)
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
